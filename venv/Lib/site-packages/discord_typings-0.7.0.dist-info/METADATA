# discord-typings

Python typings of all payloads that Discord sends as `TypedDict`s.

## Quickstart

The library requires no setup except for installation. The easiest way to
install it is through PyPI where it is similarly named `discord-typings`:

```bash
pip install discord-typings
```

Now, start importing the relevant typings directly from the library:

```python
from discord_typings import UserData


def print_author(user: UserData) -> None:
    print(f"Created by {user['username']}#{user['discriminator']}")


print_author({
    'id': '344404945359077377',
    'username': 'Bluenix',
    'discriminator': '7543',
    'avatar': None
})
```

It is also possible to import the library inside of a `TYPE_CHECKING`-clause:

```python
from typing import Any, TYPE_CHECKING

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from discord_typings import Snowflake


class Data:
    id: 'Snowflake'
    value: Any
```

> **Note**
> It is not recommended to import the library this way, as it does not allow
> you to introspect the annotations in other code. It is merely pointed out
> for completeness.

## Naming and Usage

There is no documentation or API reference as this provides no value on top of
the Discord developer documentation the types are based on. Typings are named
after the object they represent, and there are little to no
[exceptions](#exceptions) to this rule.

Typings use suffixes to differentiate between potential wrapping objects in
user code - such as importing `UserData` to parse into a custom `User` class.
These are `Data`, `Event`, and `Command`. `Event` refers to a gateway event
*received* over the gateway while `Command` refers to a gateway command *sent*
over the gateway. `Data` is used for any general objects like `UserData`.

### Exceptions

To differentiate between the data for complete application commands, and the
data Discord expects to receive to create an application command, there is
a special-cased `ApplicationCommandPayload`.

## Codestyle and Contributing

Discord-typings is a relatively simple library with little code, but
unfortunately needs to be constantly maintained with Discord's API.
The purpose of this library is for this to be a community effort;
any help with maintenance is greatly appreciated.

### Structure

The library follows the API docs both in terms of naming, structure, and order
inside of individual files. This should hopefully make it easier to find the
code to change when you have the documentation entry at hand.

All internal imports should be done by importing the entire module, then
accessing the typing as an attribute. If `from ... import ...`, or specific
things are imported, that is likely to create complicated circular imports.
Inside of annotations, wrap the attribute access (`discord_typings.X`) in
quotes to make it a string and defer its evaluation.

All typings which directly represent a Discord payload (excluding typings
created for the purpose of a `Union`) should be added to the file's `__all__`,
then be added to the module's `__init__` and its `__all__`.

## Version Guarantees

Once discord-typings releases its `v1.0` release, it will follow strict
semantic versioning guarantees. Keep in mind that this *only applies*
to the Python interface - such as `TypeDict`s, top-level unions, and
other aliases.

Due to Discord's frequent API updates, it is not guaranteed that code
which type-checks in one minor version will do so in another one. This
is because code which does not type-check will not have an effect on
runtime for users.

As a reminder of semantic versioning, and a summary of the above:

| Release Type | Upgrade | Downgrade | Comment                                           |
| ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Major**    |         |           | Only type of release with breaking Python changes |
| **Minor**    |    X    |           | May add new features, can break type-checking     |
| **Patch**    |    X    |     X     | Only intended for bugs                            |

> **Warn**
> Patch versions will be used to rectify any accidental breaking changes
> or unintended bugs / behaviour, therefore you should **always** use
> the latest patch version.

> **Note**
> Because patch versions may change previous behaviour, they *could* be
> considered breaking, however the intention is always to fix unintended
> behaviour or previous breaking changes which should not have been.
> In those cases, the previous version will be pulled from PyPI.
